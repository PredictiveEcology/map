\title{Find sources for arguments in arbitrary function(s)}
\usage{
getLocalArgsFor(fn, localFormalArgs, envir, dots)
}
\arguments{
\item{localFormalArgs}{A (named) character vector or arguments to}
}
\value{
List of named objects. The names are the formals in fn, and
the objects are the values for those formals. This can easily
be passed to do.call(fn, args1)
}
\description{
Search among local objects (which will often be arguments passed
into a function) as well as dot objects to match the
formals needed by \code{fn}. If \code{localFormalArgs} is named,
then it will match the formal (name of localFormaArgs) with the
local object, e.g., localFormalArgs = c(x = "obj") will find
the object in the local environment called "obj", and this will
be found because it matches the \code{x} argument in \code{fn}.
